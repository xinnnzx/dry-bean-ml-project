# Dry Bean Classification using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify dry bean varieties
based on morphological features as part of the CSCI218 Foundations of AI course.

## Dataset
UCI Machine Learning Repository - Dry Bean Dataset

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

## Main Features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Confusion matrix and error analysis
- Performance visualisation

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells in order.
